# Password Generator

## Overview
This program generates a random password based on user input. It prompts the user for the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password and then creates a secure password using those parameters.

## Features
- Customizable password composition (letters, symbols, and numbers).
- Randomized order of characters for enhanced security.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for:
   - Number of letters in the password.
   - Number of symbols in the password.
   - Number of numbers in the password.
2. It generates a random selection of characters based on the input using Python's `random` module and `list` data structure.
3. The characters are shuffled and combined to form the final password.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
